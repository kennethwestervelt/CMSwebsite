==========

basic CMS website
Requiers PHP5+ and mysql

this is a simple CMS web site 
- to Make the base Data base use the createbasicdb.sql script, this will create a user wit hthe name 'user1' and password 'password' you cna use this to create new users


- to get the sql connection working you must edit the includes/constants.php to reflect you sql settings you must enter your mysql user name and password

In the future I will try to automate this task to allow rapid test deployment
