CMSwebsite
==========

basic CMS website
Requiers PHP5+ and mysql

this is a simple CMS web site 
- to Make the base Data base Run this in your query or run the basicdb.sql script

// Add the creation script here

- to get the sql connection working you must edit the includes/constants.php to reflect you sql settings

In the future I will try to automate this task to allow rapid test deployment
